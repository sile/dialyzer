crash_1.erl:45: Record construction #targetlist{list::[]} violates the declared type for #targetlist{}
crash_1.erl:48: The call crash_1:get_using_branch2(Branch::maybe_improper_list(),L::'undefined' | crash_1:target()) contains an opaque term as 2nd argument argument when terms of different types are expected in these positions
crash_1.erl:50: The pattern <_Branch, []> can never match the type <maybe_improper_list(),'undefined' | crash_1:target()>
crash_1.erl:52: The attempt to match a term of type crash_1:target() against the pattern [H = {'target', _, _} | _T] breaks the opaqueness of the term
crash_1.erl:54: The attempt to match a term of type crash_1:target() against the pattern [{'target', _, _} | T] breaks the opaqueness of the term
